# Pelican-Paymenter
Pelican changed their API and Paymenter v1.0 stopped working with that and only allowed Pterodactyl.

This is a fork of that pterodactyl server extension to be able to work with Pelican too.


### Installation
```bash
cd /your/paymenter/route/extensions/Servers
mkdir Pelican
cd Pelican
```
Then Upload the file `Pelican.php` to there and you are fine, you can now create servers with Pelican!
